# Scripts

Helper scripts for development purposes.

## Installation

Clone the repository and add the clone directory to the ``PATH`` environment variable. The suggested clone directory is
``~/bin``.

## Usage

Information should not be maintained redundant. To prevent duplications, this _README.md_ doesn't document any usage
information. Instead, each script contains its own manual/help text. It will be printed, when the script is invoked with
the ``-h`` option.
